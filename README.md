<h1>Dark_Portfolio_Template</h1>
This is a portfolio web template that I made using HTML-5 , CSS3 (SCSS) and JavaScript.
Its responsive and you can toggle between three themes. I used DOM event handlers to capture mouse events and animate cursor interactions with various elements of the page.
<h5>For Desktop and Mob, Not optimised for tablets yet.</h5>
